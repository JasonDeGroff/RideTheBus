# RideTheBus
	This is a stupid little card game I made for me and for a school project. This stems from a drinking game we play in person. We are spread out pretty far now and playing in person isn't exactly super practical now. The intent is that one person runs and streams in something like discord and serves as the dealer.

## Rules
	Each player gets a turn. During that players turn the object is for them to guess correctly 4 times in a row.
	1. The first guess (stack of cards) is for the color of the card (Red or Black in a standard deck).
	2. The second guess (second stack of cards) is whether the card will be of a higher or lower value than the first.
	3. The third guess (third stack of cards) is whether the card will be between the cards value will be between or outside of the previous 2 cards values. 4. The fourth and last guess (fourth stack of cards) is for the suit of the card.
	
	If you guess any of these wrong your turn is over, you drink, and the next player goes starting over with the first guess.
	
	**In the second and third guesses, you can also guess that the cards flipped value will be the same. If you do not guess this and the card flipped matches one of the determining cards' values, you drink double.**
	
## Assets
	The assets used were free things pulled off random things like itch.io or other asset sites. This project with these assets will not be commercialized, but I have listed where I got them in assets.md with the links the site provided if it provided a specific one.
